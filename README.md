## Personas and Scenarios

### The Purpose of Storytelling

I have previously used methods of evaluation through heuristic analysis and usability testing, and conducted user-research through a relevant interview with a target user. Through the information gathered in these sectors, I will clearly communicate my users' concerns and desires from their perspective using UX storytelling methods. 

UX storytelling is a vital process within an iterative and holistic approach towards human centered design. Through patterns that I have discovered in the aforementioned sections of analysis, I have gained compelling insights that will aid me generate ideas and build prototypes to improve the design and functionality of my product. It will allow me to shift my perspective into that of the user and clearly communicate their critiques and desires. Furthermore, it will allow me to filter any biases I may carry subconsciously, as instead of basing these functions on my own ideas, I am basing them off the suggestions from my targeted users. 

In the following analysis, I will create personas based on my findings from my interviews and analysis. This will allow me to share the same image of the users. I will then create empathy maps based on those personas to express what the individuals would typically say, do, think, and feel in the contexts of them as an individual and as a consumer to my product. Finally, I will create key scenarios which illustrate a different activity/task to accomplish a feature inspired by the users’ suggestion. The features will act as a design solution and improve the functionality of the service directly according to the expressed critiques of the user.

### Design Features 

Based on the research I have conducted up until this point, I believe that incorporating the following two key design features will mitigate the three barriers to sustainable living, as defined by previous interview subjects. The barriers are defined as:

* **Time:** “The world is full of a lot of people that are trying to do good on behalf of the environment but unfortunately are really busy. Having an intentionally sustainable lifestyle is something that takes up a lot of time to coordinate and keep going.”
* **Access to information:** “Lots of information about sustainability is tied up in academia and is not as accessible to the public, so it's more effort than it should be to learn about some of these issues and what the public can do to mitigate them.”
* **Inconvenience:** “People like buying clothes and other items and having to find a way to cut down on that can be off-putting.  When you're thinking about how to get from point A to point B and do it in a way that's good for the environment, it's difficult to bike or walk everywhere. If you need to get somewhere fast, a lot of the time driving is the best option. Ultimately, I think it's hard to try to be sustainable in a world where all of our systems and tools are more geared towards continuing the status quo.”

The two following features bring potential solutions to these barriers:

* **Consolidation:** Consolidating a variety of environmentally-conscious activities and services into one mobile application is far more convenient and time efficient for the users. This feature also mitigates the issue I identified in my previous evaluations stating the privacy concerns of the user. Users often don’t want to sign up their private information to multiple different service providers, as it makes them more likely to be susceptible to information breaches. This rids the user of the aforementioned concerns, while also creating a more time-efficient and environmentally-oriented product. Consolidating several environmentally-conscious activities into one platform allows for the opportunity to educate the consumer about sustainable practices and events, as the platform dedicates itself to the notion of sustainability and sustainable living in cities and communities.
> *Target user input on consolidation: “I would definitely prefer having one platform with multiple aspects and resources because it’s more convenient and time efficient to have everything in one place. I think with having one platform dedicated to sustainability also, I would be more inclined to remember to incorporate sustainability practices into my life because there’s now a platform where that’s the main focus.”*


* **Social-Media/Community Aspect:** Presenting the application as a social media platform directly pertains to the targeted demographic of secondary students and young adults with professional careers aged 25-29. Social media usage has increased nationally by almost 1000 percent in eight years (2005-2013) for people between 18 and 29, according to findings from the Pew Research Center. More than 98 percent of college-aged students use social media, says consumer insight service Experian Simmons. In addition, an annual nationwide survey of college students by UCLA found that 27.2 percent of students spent more than six hours on social media a week in 2014, up from 19.9 percent in 2007. 
* The targeted users make up the vast majority of individuals utilizing social media. These individuals actively seek activities and ways to be connected. Presenting the app as a social media platform incentivizes target users to be environmentally conscious, promotes activities and sustainable brands, allows for information to be presented to users, connects people who are existing or potential friends, and so much more. This feature stemmed from the recommendation of an interviewed target user.
* Users would have a profile page and the option to follow their friends and others. The app could employ ads from various environmental awareness brands, which would help generate revenue. This would aid both the brands (who are in support of sustainability) and the app itself (which would donate portions of its revenue to sustainability practices). Allowing location while the app is in use may allow for the details of relevant environmental activities in the user's area to be shown, encouraging the target users to go out and participate with their friends. These events may include but are not limited to beach cleanups, planting trees/gardens, and making/distributing sustainable products. Gofundmes, petitions, and other non time-draining commitments will also be available on the app.
> *Target user input on Social Media/Community based aspect: “I think to me, I would like to see information being made more accessible to the general public in terms and have an effort made to promote education around this topic. I also really would like to see a community aspect incorporated into the platform so that users can get in touch with people around them that are also interested in sustainability. And I think my last essential would be for the platform to have an optimistic point of view. I think that it’s easy to get really pessimistic really fast about the future of the planet, and I would hope that an application geared towards helping people become more sustainable has a more positive outlook on the future and help us with the steps we can take to get there.”*

### Scenarios & Journey Map

Although the app is intended to be used by a large number of people, each with different problems and goals, the following scenarios highlight how the two key features discussed previously may help Alex and Chloe solve their issues and achieve their goals demonstrated in their respective personas.

#### 1. Alex's Scenario - Consolidation

> *This feature consolidates a variety of environmentally-conscious activities and services into one mobile application.*

Alex has had a hard time fitting into life at UCSD after moving from Baton Rouge. He loves surfing, but never has enough money for an Uber to the beach. Alex is in a real money crunch, as he also needs furniture for his new apartment and wants new clothes to help him fit it. Despite not being close with his old roommate, Alex looks up to his new one, Noah, who is from Carlsbad, California and seems to fit right into life in San Diego. Desperately wanting to fit in, Alex buys cheap clothing and accessories from Shien in an attempt to dress more like Noah.

When the package from Shein arrives, Alex shows Noah his new clothes wanting his opinion, however he does not get the reaction he was anticipating. Noah berrates Alex for buying from Shein, as they have a history of awful working conditions and participates in fast fashion, contributing waste to landfills and harming the environment. Coming from a place where sustainability was never talked about, this left Alex extremely frustrated and confused. Alex realizes it's difficult to build a habit at 19-years-old without access to proper information

A day passes, and Alex is determined to fit into his desired lifestyle at UCSD, so he finally musters up the courage to ask Noah where he gets his clothes. Noah tells Alex he gets most of his clothes from clothing swaps through this application on his phone. Alex, relieved that clothing swaps doesn’t require any money, asks Noah more questions about the app. Noah sends Alex the name of the application and tells Alex to follow his profile. Alex reads through the description of the application on the app store, and immediately notices the consolidation aspect of the application. He becomes ecstatic, as many of the services provided benefits him directly. Alex sets up his profile, optimistic that he will be able to find solutions to his issues. 

Alex follows his roommate Noah and begins to navigate through the different tabs on the application. The home tab is filled with information on sustainable living and Noah’s posts from different sustainability events on campus. After liking one of his photos, Noah shares the details of the next one he is going to with Alex on the app. This leaves Alex feeling elated as he gets to hang out with Noah, while meeting others and doing good for the local community. Alex contacts a man through the clothing swap tab, and they agree to trade some of Alex’s old clothes and the new ones he got from Shein for some graphic tees and swim shorts. In the refurbished furniture section, Alex contacts a graduate student that wants to unload a couch in good condition. They arrange a meet-up time and Alex happily takes it off the grad student’s hands. Through the rideshare section, Alex meets a junior at UCSD who goes to the beach every morning. The student agrees to take Alex to the beach whenever he goes in exchange for gas money and good company. The two become friends and Alex is able to surf whenever he wants. While scrolling through the app, Alex learns about more sustainable practices and incorporates the easy ones in his daily life. Alex dives deeper into the app, utilizing it more often, saving time and money through the services being all in the same place. He continues to wake up every morning with a new sense of belonging and fulfillment.   

Alex enjoys the consolidation aspect of the application as it saves him time and money, while offering a variety of helpful services.

#### 2. Chloe's Scenario - The Social Media/Community Aspect

> *The app is presented as a social media platform, as the targeted users make up the vast majority of individuals utilizing individuals and incentivizes the users to participate in events with friends/like minded individuals* 

Chloe, being from a beach town in California, loves nature and is extremely passionate about the environment and its well-being. Shortly after moving to New Jersey for work, she realizes her typically sustainable living style has shifted due to her demanding work schedule and new environment. Furthermore, Chloe misses her friends from home and spends whatever free time she has scrolling on social media, reminiscing about her old life in Laguna Beach. After her fourth consecutive week of the same routine which leaves Chloe feeling depressed and unfulfilled, she decides to talk to a coworker next in-person work day in hopes of making a change. 

Chloe talks to a couple of her coworkers that work in the cubicles surrounding hers about her newfound challenges. They both dismiss her quickly. Chloe’s coworkers don’t share the same interests as her or know her well since she only comes into the office once every week. They rudely suggest she should just look it up online rather than bothering them. Neither coworker does anything to help her. This interaction leaves Chloe feeling defeated. It’s hard for her to remain outgoing and optimistic when she doesn’t receive the same energy back in her limited in-person interactions. In spite of the conversation, Chloe goes home determined to make changes for the better, and begins scouring the web for solutions to her problems.  

After searching for about an hour, Chloe comes across this application that intrigues her. She notices that it is a social-media platform that doubles as a consolidator of environmentally-conscious activities. She dives deeper into the descriptions of the logistics of the app and notices that all users have a profile page and the option to follow their friends and others. She reads the section stating that allowing location while the app is in use may allow for the details of relevant environmental activities in the user's area to be shown, encouraging the target users to go out and participate with their friends. In hopes that this application would allow her to make new friends in the area and incentivize her to participate in sustainability events, Chloe downloads the app and starts making her profile.

Chloe immediately follows her friends back home through the sync your contacts feature. She loves the social-media aspect of the design, as it allows her to keep up with her friends from Laguna Beach. Through the group search feature in the app, Chloe discovers people from her workplace that use the app. She quickly follows and messages them and they arrange a time and location to meet. Having similar interests with these people, Chloe finally makes significant friends and signs up to participate in an environmental event with them. She loves the convenience of the app, as it doesn’t take up much time to sign up for events. Furthermore, she doesn’t ever feel unproductive while on the app, as spending time on a platform with such a good cause is fulfilling to her. After the event, Chloe feels whole again, knowing that she participated in an event for a cause she feels passionate about with like-minded individuals and her newfound friends. The information regarding sustainable practices on the home page of the app acts as a constant reminder to her to live an intentionally sustainable life as she once did, and Chloe is confident that she will never go back to how she felt when she first moved to New Jersey. Chloe develops a sense of belonging and continues to make friends through events and the app itself. 

Chloe enjoys the social media/community aspect of the application as it allows her to stay connected with her friends back home and make new ones in her new town.
